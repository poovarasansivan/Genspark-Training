Factory Method:

The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses decide 
which class to instantiate. It allows a class to defer instantiation to subclasses.

The client code calls a method (the factory method) to create objects instead of using 
a constructor directly.

Subclasses override this method to create specific types of objects.

Abstract Factory Pattern:

The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or 
dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

The client uses the abstract factory to create related objects (products).


Singleton Pattern:

The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
