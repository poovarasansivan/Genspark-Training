The current size of the collection is 8 

The size after removing the extra space is 5

Create an application that will take employee details (Use the employee class) and store it in a collection  

The collection should be able to give back the employee object if the employee id is provided. 

Hint – Use a collection that will store key-value pair. 

The ID of employee can never be null or have duplicate values. 

Use the application created for question 1. Store all the elements in the collection in a list. 

Sort the employees based on their salary.  

Hint – Implement the IComparable interface in the Employee class. 

Given an employee id find the employee and print the details. 

Hint – Use a LINQ with a where clause.`

Use the application created in Question 1 of medium.  

Display a menu to user which will enable to print all the employee details, add an employee, modify the details of an employee (all except id), print an employee details given his id and delete an employee from the collection
